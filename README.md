# specit
Simple budgeting/organization tool with some minor drag & drop and other simple features.

The project is serialized in the URL (for better or worse) so you can share links. But obviously you're limited in how far you can go :)

This should be pretty trivial to switch to indexeddb or something.

# To Build

This is built using .NET Framework 5.0, so you'll need to get that.

`dotnet build` and `dotnet run` should take it from there.

# Known Issues

Using Drag & Drop will mess up the totals and counts - refresh the page to fix it.
